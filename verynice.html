<h1 align=center> VeryNice</h1>
<h2> A Dynamic Process Re-nicer </h2>
<p>
VeryNice is a tool for dynamically adjusting the nice-level of processes
under UNIX-like operating systems. It can also be used to kill off 
runaway processes and increase the priority of multimedia applications, 
while properly handling both batch computation jobs and interactive 
applications with long periods of high CPU usage. 
</p>
<p>
Unlike most other process re-nice tools, VeryNice is not only capable of
lowering a CPU bound process's priority (raising the nice level), but it is also 
capable of <i>raising</i> the priority back up when the process is no longer
heavily using the CPU. It is also configurable, so it can detect different 
users and different programs and act accordingly. For example, it can 
be configured to detect and kill certain programs (such as netscape) that have 
a tendency to die with 100% cpu usage, but the program will only be killed
under stringent conditions so that it is very unlikely that it would 
be killed improperly. 
</p>
<h3> Requirements </h3>
<ul>
<li> Linux kernel 2.2 or higher on any processor or 
<li> Solaris on any processor (Tested with Solaris 2.7)
</ul>
<h3> Obtaining VeryNice</h3>
<p>
The VeryNice webpage is <A HREF=http://www.tam.cornell.edu/~sdh4/verynice/>http://www.tam.cornell.edu/~sdh4/verynice/</A>. 
<br>
VeryNice can be downloaded via http from 
<A HREF=http://www.tam.cornell.edu/~sdh4/verynice/down>http://www.tam.cornell.edu/~sdh4/verynice/down</a>
</p>
<h3> Installing VeryNice</h3>
<h4> New -- Use the provided RPM's </h4>
<p>
<tt> rpm -i verynice-[VERSION]-1.i386.rpm</tt> will install VeryNice in /usr. 
It will automatically start on the next bootup. You can start it immedately
with <tt>/etc/rc.d/init.d/verynice.init start</tt>
</p>
<h4> Build Configuration </h4>
<p>
Once you unarchive the tarball, you need to configure VeryNice. Fortunately,
this is quite simple. The parameters are listed below, and can be set either
by changing the Makefile, or by passing them on the make command line
when you do your <tt>make</tt> and <tt>make install</tt> (e.g. 
<tt>make PREFIX=/usr</tt> and <tt>make install PREFIX=/usr</tt>)
</p>
<table border=2>
<tr><th colspan=4>Configuration options</th></tr>
<tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Default</th><th>Other values</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr><td>PREFIX</td><td>/usr/local</td><td>/usr, /usr/local/pub, /opt, etc.</td><td>Prefix for installation. Binary will go in PREFIX/sbin. Documentation will go in PREFIX/doc. Configuration file will go in PREFIX/etc unless PREFIX is /usr, in which case the configuration file will go in /etc.</tr>
<tr><td>TARGET</td><td>linux</td><td>solaris</td><td>Operating system to compile for</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Often on Solaris you will need to add <tt>INSTALL=/usr/ucb/install</tt> for
the <tt>make install</tt> to work properly.
</p> 
<h4> Compiling and Installing VeryNice</h4>
<p>
Just type (as root) <tt>make [opts] ; make install [opts] </tt> and VeryNice will 
compile and install.
</p>
<h3> Running VeryNice </h3>
<p>
You will usually want to run VeryNice as root and in the background, e.g. 
<tt>/usr/local/sbin/verynice &</tt>. Typically, you will want to install
it to run automatically on startup, either from (/etc/rc.d/)<tt>rc.local</tt>
or from a SYSV-style init script placed in /etc/rc.d/init.d with appropriate
symbolic links in /etc/rc.d/rc*.d. If you give it a "-d [pidfilename]" option 
on the command line, it will automatically background itself and write it's
process id to the specified file (this option also automatically inhibits 
writing. error messages to stderr in addition to syslogd)
</p>
<h4> Procedure for Installation with SysV Init Scripts</h4>
<p>
(tested on RedHat. You may want to change PREFIX in the Makefile and in
verynice.init first.)
<pre><tt>make clean ; make ; make install
cp verynice.init /etc/rc.d/init.d
chkconfig --add verynice.init</tt></pre>
</p>
<h4> Signals </h4>
<p>
You can use the <tt>kill(1)</tt> command to send signals to VeryNice that
will change it's execution. 
<table border=2>
<tr><th>Signal</th><th>Action</th></tr>
<tr><td>SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGQUIT</td><td>Un-renice processes and exit<td></tr>
<tr><td>SIGHUP</td><td>Restart, clearing all nice levels</td></tr>
<tr><td>SIGUSR1</td><td>Dump process database to syslog</td></tr>
<tr><td>SIGUSR2</td><td>Reread configuration files (does not affect already-running processes)</td></tr>
</table>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>
VeryNice automatically reads configuration information both from a central
location (usually <tt>/etc/verynice.conf</tt> or <tt>/usr/local/etc/verynice.conf</tt>, depending
on your PREFIX) and from the home directories of individual users, in
the <tt>~/.verynicerc</tt> file. The format of both kinds of configuration 
files is the same. More restrictive settings in the global configuration
generally take precedence over individual users' settings. Of course the 
settings in a user's <tt>~/.verynicerc</tt> file only affect that user's 
processes. A sample verynice.conf file is usually installed in 
/etc/verynice.conf or /usr/local/etc/verynice.conf.

<tr><td>hungryexe</td><td>Mark an executable as "assumed to be CPU hungry". Such a process will be treated as if it were using 100% of the CPU, regardless of its actual CPU usage. This is appropriate for programs that do their real work in lots of short-lived subprocesses, such as make(1). </td><td>(none)</td><td> (As above) </td><td>Central/User</td><td>yes</td></tr>
</table>
<h5> A note about "karma"</h5>
<p>Processes are tracked and reniced according to their "bad karma". Bad karma
is accumulated whenever the process hogs the CPU, and is reduced if the 
process is idle. "goodexe" processes have negative bad karma (i.e. good karma).

</p>
<h3> Security </h3>
<p>
VeryNice was written with security in mind, nevertheless is is impossible 
to guarantee that there aren't any holes. Users in general CAN use VeryNice
to renice their processes to negative nice values, up to the centrally configured "notnice" value (default -4). Remember, VeryNice runs 
as root
on the local host and does not support network access. However, it does 
access and read information from individual users' configuration files.
For security reasons, the configuration files will be used only if they 
are regular files and are not symbolic links. 
</p>
<h3> Scalability </h3>
<p>
VeryNice should scale without any trouble to extremely large networks
with very large numbers of users. 
</p>
<h3> Troubleshooting </h3>
<table border=2>
<tr><th>Problem</th><th>Possible cause</th></tr>
<tr><td>VeryNice sets all processes (even root-owned) to nice-level zero
on startup</td><td>VeryNice cannot find it's configuration file. Try a 'make clean' and rebuilding it with the proper PREFIX, then a make install with the same PREFIX. Make sure you're not running an old copy that was installed in another directory</td></tr>
<tr><td>Processes aren't identified properly on Solaris</td><td>VeryNice can currently only identify the filename of the executables on Solaris, not their complete paths. However, you can use a leading slash in the configuration file to force a precise match of the filename. For example "X" will match both "X" and "Xserver", but "/X" will only match "X" and not "Xserver".</td></tr>
<tr><td>I'm confused about what VeryNice is doing</td><td>Try looking at VeryNice's process database. This will give renice levels, karma levels, and configuration flags. It can be dumped with <tt>kill -USR1 [verynice_process_id]</tt>.
