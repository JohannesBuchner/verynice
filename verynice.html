<h1 align=center> VeryNice</h1>
<h2> A Dynamic Process Re-nicer </h2>
<p>
VeryNice is a tool for dynamically adjusting the nice-level of processes
under UNIX-like operating systems. It can also be used to kill off 
runaway processes and increase the priority of multimedia applications, 
while properly handling both batch computation jobs and interactive 
applications with long periods of high CPU usage. 
</p>
<p>
Unlike most other process re-nice tools, VeryNice is not only capable of
lowering a CPU bound process's priority (raising the nice level), but it is also 
capable of <i>raising</i> the priority back up when the process is no longer
heavily using the CPU. It is also configurable, so it can detect different 
users and different programs and act accordingly. For example, it can 
be configured to detect and kill certain programs (such as netscape) that have 
a tendency to die with 100% cpu usage, but the program will only be killed
under stringent conditions so that it is very unlikely that it would 
be killed improperly. 
</p>
<h3> Requirements </h3>
<ul>
<li> Linux kernel 2.2 or higher on any processor or 
<li> Solaris on any processor (Tested with Solaris 2.7)
</ul>
<h3> Obtaining VeryNice</h3>
<p>
The VeryNice webpage is <A HREF=http://www.tam.cornell.edu/~sdh4/verynice/>http://www.tam.cornell.edu/~sdh4/verynice/</A>. 
<br>
VeryNice can be downloaded via http from 
<A HREF=http://www.tam.cornell.edu/~sdh4/verynice/down>http://www.tam.cornell.edu/~sdh4/verynice/down</a>
</p>
<h3> Installing VeryNice</h3>
<h4> Build Configuration </h4>
<p>
Once you unarchive the tarball, you need to configure VeryNice. Fortunately,
this is quite simple. The parameters are listed below, and can be set either
by changing the Makefile, or by passing them on the make command line
when you do your <tt>make</tt> and <tt>make install</tt> (e.g. 
<tt>make PREFIX=/usr</tt> and <tt>make install PREFIX=/usr</tt>)
</p>
<table border=2>
<tr><th colspan=4>Configuration options</th></tr>
<tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Default</th><th>Other values</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr><td>PREFIX</td><td>/usr/local</td><td>/usr, /usr/local/pub, /opt, etc.</td><td>Prefix for installation. Binary will go in PREFIX/sbin. Documentation will go in PREFIX/doc. Configuration file will go in PREFIX/etc unless PREFIX is /usr, in which case the configuration file will go in /etc.</tr>
<tr><td>TARGET</td><td>linux</td><td>solaris</td><td>Operating system to compile for</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Often on Solaris you will need to add <tt>INSTALL=/usr/ucb/install</tt> for
the <tt>make install</tt> to work properly.
</p> 
<h4> Compiling and Installing VeryNice</h4>
<p>
Just type (as root) <tt>make [opts] ; make install [opts] </tt> and VeryNice will 
compile and install.
</p>
<h3> Running VeryNice </h3>
<p>
You will usually want to run VeryNice as root and in the background, e.g. 
<tt>/usr/local/sbin/verynice &</tt>. Typically, you will want to install
it to run automatically on startup, either from (/etc/rc.d/)<tt>rc.local</tt>
or from a SYSV-style init script placed in /etc/rc.d/init.d with appropriate
symbolic links in /etc/rc.d/rc*.d.
</p>
<h4> Signals </h4>
<p>
You can use the <tt>kill(1)</tt> command to send signals to VeryNice that
will change it's execution. 
<table border=2>
<tr><th>Signal</th><th>Action</th></tr>
<tr><td>SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGQUIT</td><td>Un-renice processes and exit<td></tr>
<tr><td>SIGHUP</td><td>Restart, clearing all nice levels</td></tr>
<tr><td>SIGUSR1</td><td>Dump process database to syslog</td></tr>
<tr><td>SIGUSR2</td><td>Reread configuration files (does not affect already-running processes)</td></tr>
</table>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
<p>
VeryNice automatically reads configuration information both from a central
location (usually <tt>/etc/verynice.conf</tt> or <tt>/usr/local/etc/verynice.conf</tt>, depending
on your PREFIX) and from the home directories of individual users, in
the <tt>~/.verynicerc</tt> file. The format of both kinds of configuration 
files is the same. More restrictive settings in the global configuration
generally take precedence over individual users' settings. Of course the 
settings in a user's <tt>~/.verynicerc</tt> file only affect that user's 
processes. A sample verynice.conf file is usually installed in 
/etc/verynice.conf or /usr/local/etc/verynice.conf.

<tr><td>batchjob</td><td>Set the nice-level of "badexe" processes</td><td> 18 </td><td>Any positive number less than 20</td><td>Central</td><td>no</td>

<tr><td>periodicity</td><td>Set the approximate number of seconds between iterations through the process analysis code of VeryNice</td><td> 60 </td>  <td> Any positive integer. Large values use less CPU. Small values give more precise performance. </td><td>Central</td><td>no</td></tr>
<tr><td>rereadcfgperiodicity</td><td>Set the approximate number of program cycles (periodicities, above)  between attempts to reread the configuration files of VeryNice</td><td> 60 </td>  <td> Any positive integer.

<tr><td>immuneuser</td><td>Inhibit VeryNice from modifying the nice level of a user's processes, except for "goodexe", below, if set in the central config file.</td><td>(none)</td><td>Any user name, unquoted</td><td>Central</td><td>yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>immuneexe</td><td>Inhibit VeryNice from modifying the nice level of certain executables</td><td>(none)</td><td>Any substring of the complete path to the executable, quoted with double quotes ("). If it begins with '/', it must match the complete path precisely. </td><td>Central/User</td><td>yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>badexe</td><td>Force the nice level of an executable to the BATCHJOB level</td><td>(none)</td><td> (As above)</td><td>Central/User</td><td>yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>goodexe</td><td>Force the nice level of an executable to the NOTNICE level. This is typically used for real-time multimedia applications which need high priority</td><td>(none)</td><td> (As above) </td><td>Central/User</td><td>yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>runawayexe</td><td>Mark an executable as a potential runaway process. Only processes specially marked will ever be killed by VeryNice</td><td>(none)</td><td> (As above) </td><td>Central/User</td><td>yes</td></tr>
</table>
<h3> Security </h3>
<p>
VeryNice was written with security in mind, nevertheless is is impossible 
to guarantee that there aren't any holes. Users in general CAN use VeryNice
to renice their processes to negative nice values, up to the centrally configured "notnice" value (default -4). Remember, VeryNice runs 
as root
on the local host and does not support network access. However, it does 
access and read information from individual users' configuration files.
For security reasons, the configuration files will be used only if they 
are regular files and are not symbolic links. 
</p>
<h3> Scalability </h3>
<p>
The primary scalability problem for the time being is the necessity to 
read all the configuration files of all the users on startup, and periodically
for updates. This could be a problem on networks with many fileservers and
thousands of users. If you are in this situation, it might be a good idea
to both add a random wait on bootup for the verynice startup (so your 
fileservers don't get bogged down after a power failure) and also 
dramatically increase the rereadcfgperiodicity, so the system doesn't 
attempt to reread the configuration very often. 
</p>
<h3> Troubleshooting </h3>
<table border=2>
<tr><th>Problem</th><th>Possible cause</th></tr>
<tr><td>VeryNice sets all processes (even root-owned) to nice-level zero
on startup</td><td>VeryNice cannot find it's configuration file. Try a 'make clean' and rebuilding it with the proper PREFIX, then a make install with the same PREFIX. Make sure you're not running an old copy that was installed in another directory</td></tr>
<tr><td>VeryNice uses an aweful lot of CPU and takes a while before renicing any processes on startup</td><td>VeryNice has to read all the user's configuration files before continuing. This can take a while if you have a lot of users or your fileserver is slow </td></tr>
