The "config.syn" source file for VeryNice is for use with the AnaGram
parser generator. AnaGram will generate the "config.c" and "config.h"
files from config.syn.  You can download a trial version of AnaGram
from http://www.parsifalsoft.com.

As of this writing, AnaGram is not yet available for Linux (the version
used for development was a test release). Nevertheless, if you need to 
recreate the config.c and config.h files, the Windows version will work just
fine.
