VeryNice 1.1
------------
"badexe" setting didn't work in 1.0. Fixed

VeryNice 1.0
------------
Now logs executable location along with pid and uid when killing process
System log message for SIGTERM no longer claims to be SIGKILL
Added more return value sanity checks for system calls. 


VeryNice 0.8
------------
A working SysV style init script is now provided. 
-d [pidfile] option for automatic process-id file generation added. 
"hungryexe" option added
VeryNice now only looks up per-user configuration information for users
who are actually logged in, not all users with accounts (dramatic scalability
improvement). 
cpu count detection is now properly OS-dependent. Warning message about 
lack of cpu count support added for Solaris
We got SIGKILL and SIGTERM backwards the first time around, so processes
weren't getting a cahnce to clean themselves up before being killed.


VeryNice 0.5 
------------
First release
